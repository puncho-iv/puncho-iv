## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m Ebenezer Clottey, a proactive and versatile engineer and designer with a passion for basketball and exploring new places.

**Experience**

I specialize in React Native, where Iâ€™m currently developing a mobile application aimed at connecting clients with artisans for their everyday needs. The application uses GraphQL for efficient and optimized data retrieval.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    **Tech: React Native | Nest | Redux | React | Nuxt**
 
I have also worked on proects which gave me experience in react js, react native, nuxt and redux. Some projects are:

          â€¢ MTN|aYo Pay and Drive(https://app.ayoghana.com/)
          â€¢ MTN|aYo Pay and Drive Admin System(https://adminpayd.ayoghana.com/) request test logins 
          â€¢ MTN|aYo Annual Cover Admin System ()

          â€¢ UniSalad Mobile App (https://www.unisalad.com/)
          â€¢ POs system (https://pos-mjsq.onrender.com/)
 
Additional Skills: Data Annotation | Machine Learning (beginner)

While Iâ€™m passionate about React, I select the right tools for each task based on factors such as community support, ease of use, reusability, and maintainability.

 
âš¡ Fun fact: I love to party
