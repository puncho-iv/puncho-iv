Experience 

â€¢ With my expertise in React Native, I am currently developing a mobile application designed to help clients easily locate artisans for their everyday needs. The backend is implemented using GraphQL, allowing precise control over the data retrieved, ensuring efficient and optimized performance.
 Tech: React Native | Nest | Redux
 
I have also worked on proects which gave me experience in react js, react native, nuxt and redux. Some projects are:

 â€¢ MTN|aYo Pay and Drive(https://app.ayoghana.com/)
 â€¢ MTN|aYo Pay and Drive Admin System(https://adminpayd.ayoghana.com/) request test logins 
 â€¢ UniSalad Mobile App (https://www.unisalad.com/)
 â€¢ MTN|aYo Annual Cover Admin System ()
 
I am a Backend Developer learner, Data Anotator and Machine Learning rookie.

Although I love Nuxt, I pick the right tool or a task considering actors like community, ease of use, reusability and maintainability
âš¡ Fun fact: I love to party
